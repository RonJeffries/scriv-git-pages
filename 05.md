# Styles #

Scrivener lets you assign “Styles” to paragraphs, and you can control how those styles get compiled into the output. So, in principle, I could set up a “Heading 2” style such that when I format a paragraph with Heading 2, it would look different in my editor, and (I believe) I could make it compile with the ## in front of it that signify H2 to Markdown. For now, I’m not going to do that: I’m going to type my own Markdown marks, because I’m used to it.
